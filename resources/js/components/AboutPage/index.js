            <h2>The Team</h2>
            <p>
                We are a small team operating from Leeds, UK and Tokyo, Japan.
                We like to think that the latter is synonymous with precision
                timing, just like your event will be. We built Events Countdown
                as there was no other software available allowing users to make
                a countdown timer quick and easy. Although our team is small, we
                value our users and invite you to drop us a line using the below
                contact form should you have any questions/feedback (or just
                fancy a chat!)
            </p>
